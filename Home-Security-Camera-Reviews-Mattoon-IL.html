<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the hazard of terrorist attacks. However suicide aggressors are plainly not hindered by video cameras - and might even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can guarantee - and the expenditure of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up around 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited advantages that the system might offer in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the reality (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract may be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems generally don't included upfront fees. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the agreement. We have actually seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
