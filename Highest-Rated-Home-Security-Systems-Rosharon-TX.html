Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
