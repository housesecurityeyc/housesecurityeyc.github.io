<p>Nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit validation for the current push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide attackers are plainly not hindered by video cameras - and might even be brought in to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far surpasses the limited benefits that the system might supply in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
