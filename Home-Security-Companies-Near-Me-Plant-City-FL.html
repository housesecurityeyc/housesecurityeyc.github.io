Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more costly for the same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
