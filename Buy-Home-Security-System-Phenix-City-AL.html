<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan alternative. Sure, you get a lower rate if you choose a three-year contract, but considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the better deal for you. Go with the contract and reap those savings if you know you'll remain put for at least three years. However if you might update to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send out mobile phone signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
