<p>Thermal cameras are the best choice for more severe conditions and rugged areas. These cameras record the heat patterns of animals and people, therefore picking out movement in storms, dense trees or plants, or hazy, smoky, foggy, or dirty conditions.

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and family and friends) fave.
