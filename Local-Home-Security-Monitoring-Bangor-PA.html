<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients realize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
