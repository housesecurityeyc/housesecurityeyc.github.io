<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>

Still, the unmonitored system is much less pricey and therefore is still the better alternative for lots of who are just concerned about cost. </p>
