<p>Because it's more complicated than it must be, we do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month.
