<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Security cameras are suggested to be discreet devices. Some have protective dome lenses and others have night vision technology.

We likewise carry associated devices, such as cables, extension cables, and microphones to match your security and surveillance experience. </p>
