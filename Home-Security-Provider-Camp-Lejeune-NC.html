Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security given that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
