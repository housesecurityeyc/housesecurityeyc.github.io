<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more expensive for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are difficult, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyway.</p>
<p>In addition they can not transfer fluid video, just still frame images or low resolution snippets of video. Blink Security Cameras are a good example of a system we are continuously helping clients change. As professionals in the industry our guidance is to stay away. If you do buy them, initially examine the providers return policy and 2nd keep the invoice.</p>
