<p>Think about it in this manner, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more sophisticated camera be cost the low price of forty dollars? It just does not accumulate. To provide such low prices, makers need to cut corners, and completion outcome is compromised performance. What good is a surveillance camera that just works ideally in ideal conditions like brilliant sunshine?
