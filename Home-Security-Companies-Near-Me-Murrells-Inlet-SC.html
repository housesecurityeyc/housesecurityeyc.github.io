So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I remained in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the swelling amount, due to the fact that apparently they car renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.
