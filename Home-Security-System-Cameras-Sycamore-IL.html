<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
