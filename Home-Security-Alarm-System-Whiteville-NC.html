<p>Alder doesn't promote rates for its security systems online, and because each client's specific system may differ, the cost might vary also. We're unable to compare Alder to other providers concerning cost, however Alder does offer the fundamentals and more for protecting your home, and we believe that adds to the provider's overall value.</p>

Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Having the ability to compare a person and a cars and truck, for instance, allows you to cut down on unnecessary informs. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, specifically if you're looking to monitor a specific corner of the backyard, a doorway, or even garbage cans. </p>
