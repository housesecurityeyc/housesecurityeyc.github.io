<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more responsible for incorrect alarms, and minimize the number of unneeded cops and fire actions. Alarm monitoring companies are the professionals and need to be teaching their customers how to effectively set and care for their alarm systems.

Alarm-monitoring companies have taken pleasure in the benefit of police action to their customers' alarms with no responsibility for the precision or reliability of those alarms.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not especially groundbreaking, so we're really recommending the security cameras here.

So select what will be the much better deal for you. If you know you'll sit tight for a minimum of three years, go with the contract and enjoy those savings. However if you may update to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best choice.</p>
