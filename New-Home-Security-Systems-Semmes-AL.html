Regrettably, history has actually revealed that surveillance innovations put in place for one function inevitably broaden into other usages. And with video innovation most likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems ought to be able to do positions a substantial threat.</p>

When possible, we evaluated each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint uses a wide variety of equipment and home automation items at an affordable cost, the one location where the company especially stands out remains in DIY installation. </p>
