<p>The majority of the self-monitored starter sets do not include outdoor cameras. Outdoor cameras are a bit harder to install because they have to be mounted to a home.

In an effort to keep starter packages simple to install and affordable, they're typically overlooked of the basic packages.</p>

Wireless cameras can't have everything-- view things inside by day, and watch on what's going on outside after dark. It rarely works.</p>
