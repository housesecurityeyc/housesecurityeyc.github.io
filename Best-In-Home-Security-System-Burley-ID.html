<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 each month, which could be an inexpensive option for consumers in rural areas. We recommend cellular systems since they're much more secure than landline systems, however there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still far better than no security at all.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly groundbreaking, so we're really suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year contract, however since Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the much better deal for you. Go with the agreement and enjoy those cost savings if you know you'll stay put for at least 3 years. However if you might update to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best option.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their quick reaction times and overall adaptability. And controlling our system with their touchscreen panel was quite darn and simple and easy streamlined.
