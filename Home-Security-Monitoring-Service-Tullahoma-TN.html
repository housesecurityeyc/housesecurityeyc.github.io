These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to overlook objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
